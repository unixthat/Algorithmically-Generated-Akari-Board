# Algorithmically-Generated-Akari-Board

Algorithmically-Generated-Akari-Board is a Java implementation of the popular puzzle game Akari/Light up. The repository generates puzzles algorithmically based on a specified difficulty level, providing a fun and challenging puzzle-solving experience.

## Purpose

The purpose of this project is to provide an implementation of the Akari/Light up game in Java that is clean, well-documented, and organized. The repository aims to provide a solid foundation for future expansion and contributions.

## Classes

The following classes can be used to implement the Akari/Light up game in Java:

- `AkariGame`: This class represents the main game logic and contains methods for loading a puzzle, solving a puzzle, checking if the puzzle is solved, and updating the game state when a cell is clicked or marked.

- `AkariGrid`: This class represents the game board and contains methods for getting and setting cell values, checking if a cell is blocked, lit, or empty, and toggling the block or light state of a cell.

- `AkariUI`: This class represents the user interface and contains methods for drawing the game board on the screen, waiting for user input, and showing messages to the user.

- `AkariSolver`: This class represents the solver and contains methods for solving the puzzle using backtracking or other techniques, checking if a solution is valid, and checking if the puzzle is solved.

- `AkariGenerator`: This class represents the puzzle generator and contains methods for generating a new puzzle with a given size and difficulty level, and checking if a generated puzzle is valid or solvable.

Note that this is just a basic outline and there may be additional methods and classes required depending on the specific implementation.

## Installation and Usage

To use Algorithmically-Generated-Akari-Board, follow these steps:

1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Navigate to the repository directory.
3. Run the `Main` class.

This will generate and solve a new puzzle based on the specified difficulty level, printing the results to the console.

In addition, the `AkariGame` class provides several additional methods that can be used to customize and interact with the puzzle. These include the ability to manually place and remove lights, check for valid solutions, and display the board in a user-friendly format.
