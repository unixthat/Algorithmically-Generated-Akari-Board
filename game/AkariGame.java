/**
 * The `AkariGame` class represents the main game logic for the Akari/Light Up puzzle game. It is responsible for
 * loading puzzles from files or generating new ones, solving puzzles using backtracking or other techniques,
 * and maintaining the game state, including the game board and the player's progress.
 *
 * The `AkariGame` class depends on the `AkariGrid`, `AkariUI`, `AkariSolver`, and `AkariGenerator` classes to
 * perform its functions. The input format for puzzles is a custom text format that specifies the layout of the
 * game board and the locations of the numbered cells, while the output format is a visual representation of the
 * game board on the screen.
 *
 * Assumptions and Limitations:
 * - The maximum size of the game board is currently set to 20x20 cells, but can be adjusted in the `AkariGrid`
 *   class if needed.
 * - The puzzle files must be located in the `puzzles` directory in the project root.
